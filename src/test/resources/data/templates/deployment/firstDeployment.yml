# description of the procedure that the checklist will support
description: Checklist to monitor a first deployment of an application
# tags help you organise your checklists. The tags in the template are automatically added to all checklists that are 
# based on this template. You can add as many as you need
tags:
    - deployment
    - software
# The steps represent the various parts of the procedure.
steps :    
      # the id must be unique within the template
    - id: createDeploymentEnvironment
      # who should perform this action
      responsible: deployer
      # the action to be performed. You should either have an action or a subchecklist (see further)      
      action: request the deployment environment
      # the verification to be executed when the action is performed. Can be a single item or a list (see next step for example)
      check: log on the deployment station
      # an optional milestone that is considered to be reached when this step is ok
      milestone: readyForDeployment
    - id: createApplication
      responsible: deployer
      action: create the application in the proper zone      
      # an example with multiple checks for 1 action (when you want more than 1 action, simply create new steps)
      check:
          - step: open webconsole in the proper zone
          - step: application should be present and green
      # the weight of this step in the progress bar to get a more realistic progress if you want (if not specified : default = 1)
      weight: 5
    - id: verifyFunctioning
      responsible: development
      # the documentation tag will be rendered as a link in the webgui.. You can use it when you need to give context, add a screenshot... 
      # you simply describe it in a document/wiki/webpage/... and point the user into that direction in your action
