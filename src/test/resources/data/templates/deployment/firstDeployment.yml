# description of the procedure that the checklist will support
description: Checklist to monitor a first deployment of an application
# tags help you organise your checklists. The tags in the template are automatically added to all checklists that are 
# based on this template. You can add as many as you need
tags:
    - deployment
    - software
# The steps represent the various parts of the procedure.
steps :    
      # the id must be unique within the template
    - id: createSecureGit
      # who should perform this action
      responsible: middleware
      # the action to be performed. You should either have an action or a subtemplate (see further)      
      action: request secure GIT to JDSS. Request URL
      # the verification to be executed when the action is performed. Can be a single item or a list (see next step for example)
      check: on the deployment station, perform git clone with the URL from JDSS
      # an optional milestone that is considered to be reached when this step is ok
      milestone: readyForDeployment
    - id: createApplication
      responsible: middleware
      action: create the application in the proper zone
      # the documentation tag will be rendered as a link in the webgui.. You can use it when you need to give context, add a screenshot... 
      # you simply describe it in a document/wiki/webpage/... and point the user into that direction in your action
      documentation: https://github.com/kullervo16/checklist
      # an example with multiple checks for 1 action (when you want more than 1 action, simply create new steps)
      check:
          - step: verify proper gear type (must match environment)
          - step: rhc ssh <application> -n <domain>    
      # the weight of this step in the progress bar to get a more realistic progress if you want (if not specified : default = 1)
      weight: 5
    - id: odtInit
      responsible: middleware
      action: perform odt init
      check: project is on disk
      milestone: deployed
