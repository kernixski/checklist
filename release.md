# Release management

## 0.1 (2016-01-03)

### Release content
This is the minimal viable product. It supports :

* create a checklist from a template
* tags
* milestones
* simple workflow 
  * selection from a predefined list. 
  * the selected option influences the other steps
* subchecklists
* persistence

### Known issues

* templates need to be added manually in the store (/opt/checklist/templates). No validation provided (the exception will tell you when its wrong :-) )
* no statistics yet (buttons in the template view aren't implemented yet)
